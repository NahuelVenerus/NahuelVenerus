# Personal Repository of Nahuel Venerus

Hello! I'm Nahuel Venerus, and this is my personal repository on GitHub. Here you will find a variety of projects, code examples, and resources related to my work and areas of interest.

## About Me

I am a Full Stack Developer with strong skills in teamwork, planning and meeting goals. I've had the opportunity to work in many projects as a team, using tools to help organize, like trello, and plan meetings through Agile and Scrum. Through a good task assignment, assertive comunication and time management allowed us to achieve the goals in the stablished periods.
I love learning new things, working on myself and constantly improving!
My English level is advanced and I have experience in Agile, Scrum and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
I am looking for new challenges that boost my personal and professional growth, where I can apply my skills and work in collaborative environments.
